Summary
--------
A/B Testing, or Split Testing, is a method of testing one change on a page – the wording of a headline or the placement of a button, for example – to see how it performs compared to the original. Users follow one URL and are either shown the original (version A, the control) or redirected to an edited version (version B, the treatment).

For information on testing multiple changes in different combinations, see [Multivariate Testing](Tests-multivariés.md).
